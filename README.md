# WPF_Tomfoolery
General fooling with WPF in the moooorning. Hello, World!

Main files:

MainWindow.xaml

MainWindow.xaml.cs

I also added some pics to show what the program does. Enjoy my janky hello world form and back in its glory. I have a lot of studying to do. At least coding is pretty intuitive here. I was concerned that perhaps the switch from console programs to programs with an actual UI might screw with me, but nah. So far, so good. Knock on wood.
